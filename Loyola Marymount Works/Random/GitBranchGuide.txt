To make a new branch and use for a github repo project:
  Make new branch
    - git branch <branch-name>
    OR
    - make new branch on repository site
  Switch to new branch
    - git checkout <branch-name>
  Make new remote
    - git remote add <remote-name> <branch-url>

Should be good to go at this point. When finished, you should delete the branch by running:
  Locally first
    - git branch -d <branch-name>
  Then the remote from server
    - git push origin --delete <remote-name>
